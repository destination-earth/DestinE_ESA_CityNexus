  <span style="">A novel urban digital twin application</span>
</p>
</div>

CITYNEXUS is an innovative urban digital twin application designed to assess the **environmental, social, and economic impacts of changes in road networks, mobility, and urban space design**.

Leveraging the DestinE system, CITYNEXUS aims to evaluate baseline conditions for human mobility, including key indicators like air quality, population distribution, public health, and service accessibility and integrates live what-if scenario capabilities.

The platform is designed to provide policymakers a **collaborative platform to experiment with various strategies and solutions**, considering diverse factors and variables crucial for successful and sustainable urban interventions, thereby facilitating a coordinated approach to decision-making.

<h2>CITYNEXUS Platform Overview</h2>

The CITYNEXUS platform aims to facilitate evidence-based decision-making at the municipality level by providing capabilities to **evaluate a comprehensive set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and by implementing an **interactive system for assessing the impact of infrastructural and mobility changes on the target KPIs** through policy-relevant, user-defined ‘what-if’ scenario simulations.

Currently, strategic decisions related to mobility and infrastructural interventions are primarily driven by economic constraints, thus overlooking the complex and multifaceted impacts on neighbourhoods and local communities. This issue is further exacerbated by a limited coordination and communication between districts of the same city or neighbouring municipalities, hence making it challenging to assess the holistic impact of a specific intervention on nearby areas.

To address these limitations, CITYNEXUS offers policymakers a collaborative environment where they can freely experiment with different strategies and solutions. It provides a comprehensive decision-making framework that goes beyond simplistic cost considerations and considers the specific needs expressed by the user community (reflected in the selected KPIs). In this regard, CITYNEXUS targets a set of KPIs (preliminary identified together with the end users) addressing different thematic areas, namely:

1.	**Mobility Patterns**: CityNexus provides detailed insights into commuting patterns, travel behavior, traffic flows, congestion rates, peak traffic hours, and overall mobility dynamics in the city. This information is crucial for understanding and addressing the challenges of urban transport and traffic management.
2.	**Air Quality**: The platform evaluates the concentration of various pollutants at ground level, like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), black carbon particles, and ultrafine particles.
3.	**Dynamic Population Distribution**: CityNexus describes human presence patterns over time, aiding in the understanding of population movements and densities in different city areas.
4.	**Public Environmental Health**: The platform assesses how air pollution affects public health, including the incidence of diseases associated with exposure to different pollutants.
5.	**Service Accessibility**: It evaluates the availability, accessibility, and equity of key urban services such as transportation, healthcare, education, workplaces, commercial, and recreational facilities.

To support evidence-based decision making at the municipality level, CITYNEXUS operates at the **local scale**. To characterize the seasonal patterns of human mobility and, in turn, their relationships to the targeted KPIs, CITYNEXUS is intended to operate on a quarterly temporal scale and to differentiate the analyses between typical weekdays and weekends. On the one hand, this allows deriving statistically robust baseline conditions when characterizing the reference patterns for the human mobility and the different KPIs. On the other hand, this enables a more realistic and nuanced understanding of the effects of “what-if” mobility and infrastructural changes at different times of the year.

Four cities are currently available for demonstration purposes in the platform: **Copenhagen** (Denmark), **Bologna** (Italy), **Seville** (Spain), and **Aarhus** (Denmark). These cities were selected as first targets for their alignment with the project’s focus on sustainable mobility, air quality improvement, and urban innovation. In principle all cities participating in the EU Mission for 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 underscore a shared commitment to climate adaptation and sustainable urban development, hence they are candidates for future adaptations and extensions of the platform.

The CITYNEXUS models have been trained using:

- High Frequency Location Based (HFLB) mobility data
- Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Level2 daily tropospheric NO2, SO2, CO, O3 vertical column densities
- Copernicus Digital Elevation Model of Europe at 10m resolution
- ECMWF ERA5 hourly estimates for different meteorological variables
- CORINE Land Cover from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service at 100m

<h2>Impact</h2>

CITYNEXUS leverages a cutting-edge platform like DestinE, EO data and advanced AI to support urban resilience and environmental management. By integrating geospatial intelligence, heterogeneous data sources, and AI modelling, it enables scenario-based decision-making for sustainable urban and regional development. CITYNEXUS’s key application areas include:

1.	**Climate Adaptation for Public Stakeholders.** CITYNEXUS allows European cities to simulate and assess the impacts of climate-related interventions—such as road redesigns or low-emission zones—on air quality, noise, and liveability. Currently developed for Copenhagen, Aarhus, Seville, and Bologna, the approach is scalable across Europe in alignment with the EU’s climate adaptation goals.
2.	**Computational Geoscience & Local-Scale Modelling.** The platform combines EO, meteorological (e.g. ERA5), mobility, and sensor-based pollution data to model the environmental and mobility impacts of urban interventions. It enables predictive planning at both local and regional scales.
3.	**Data Integration & DestinE Service Usage.** CITYNEXUS draws extensively from the DestinE Data Portfolio (e.g., Sentinel-5P, ERA5, MERRA-2, Copernicus DEM, CORINE Land Cover), and the  four-day global simulations from the DestinE Digital Twin for Weather-Induced Extremes, demonstrating full alignment with the EU’s digital infrastructure and supporting integration with broader EU data strategies.
4.	**Urban and Regional Development Support**. Designed to inform policy and planning decisions, CITYNEXUS helps stakeholders visualize the effects of infrastructural and policy changes, promoting sustainable mobility, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced urban quality of life.

Possible use cases for future exploitation of CITYNEXUS include:

- **Policy Impact Simulation.** Enables cities to simulate policies (e.g., low-emission zones, speed limits) and assess outcomes on traffic, emissions, and public health—supporting evidence-based decisions and stakeholder communication.
- **Urban Design & Redevelopment Assessment**. Helps planners evaluate how urban regeneration (e.g., converting industrial zones) affects mobility, accessibility, and air quality, ensuring balanced, sustainable development.
- **Infrastructure Change Analysis.** Models the impact of large-scale projects (e.g., tunnelling motorways) on travel patterns, pollution, and land use, supporting more effective and community-focused investments.

<h2>Policy addressed</h2>

- **Urban planning** policies, intended as regulations, guidelines, and strategies formulated and implemented by government authorities, urban planners, and policymakers to manage and shape the development, growth, and sustainability of urban areas.
- **Environmental** planning policies, intended as regulations and strategies aimed at managing and enhancing the sustainability, livability, and ecological aspects of urban areas, with a focus on urban design, transportation, and environmental quality.
- **Transportation** Policies, intended as policies related to public transportation, traffic management, road safety, and alternative transportation modes (e.g., cycling and walking), which impact both urban and environmental planning.
- **Public Health** Policies, intended as policies that address public health concerns associated with urban environments, specifically related to air quality regulations.
