The City of Copenhagen is addressing traffic congestion and aiming for sustainable urban development in Ã˜restad, a mixed-use area in the Amager Vest district. This sector, comprising residential, commercial, and university buildings, with a significant population in each, plans to transform its main thoroughfare to better manage traffic, improve air quality, and enhance living standards. Central to this initiative is understanding how the outcomes of these hypotheses of transformation for human mobility, service accessibility, air quality, and public environmental health. The city has a strong interest in exploring innovative tools for interactive assessment of different spatial planning and urban development options and for evaluating tradeoffs of climate adaptation policies and regulatory changes, hence supporting data-driven decision-making in urban planning.</span>

To respond to the needs of the Local Council of Amager Vest and the City of Copenhagen, **CityNexus** is an innovative **urban digital twin application designed to assess the environmental, social, and economic impacts of changes in road networks, mobility, and urban space design**.  CityNexus aims to evaluate baseline conditions for human mobility, including key indicators like air quality, population distribution, public health, and service accessibility and integrates live what-if scenario capabilities.

<h2>Solution</h2>

The CityNexus platform, designed for the Copenhagen Greater Metropolitan Area, aims to facilitate evidence-based decision-making at the municipality level. It targets a comprehensive set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across five thematic areas. These include:
1.	**Mobility Patterns**: CityNexus provides detailed insights into commuting patterns, travel behavior, traffic flows, congestion rates, peak traffic hours, and overall mobility dynamics in the city. This information is crucial for understanding and addressing the challenges of urban transport and traffic management.
2.	**Air Quality**: The platform evaluates the concentration of various pollutants at ground level, like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), black carbon particles, and ultrafine particles. It leverages data from mobile mapping campaigns, in-situ stations, and advanced AI techniques to downscale Sentinel-5P data to a 100m spatial resolution, providing a precise picture of the city's air quality.
3.	**Dynamic Population Distribution**: CityNexus describes human presence patterns over time, aiding in the understanding of population movements and densities in different city areas.
4.	**Public Environmental Health**: The platform assesses how air pollution affects public health, including the incidence of diseases associated with exposure to different pollutants.
5.	**Service Accessibility**: It evaluates the availability, accessibility, and equity of key urban services such as transportation, healthcare, education, workplaces, commercial, and recreational facilities.
