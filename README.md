# Immersive Visualization Metaverse (IMMERSIVE EO) 

This activity aims at developing an **immersive visualization application** associated with an EO use case. This implementation will benefit from and will allow the exploitation of some key techniques/technologies of **Virtual and Augmented Reality** and **Artificial Intelligence**. The project contributes to demonstrating how **Digital Twins can serve Policy and Decision Makers** in understanding the status of relevant environmental parameters, simulating changes/phenomena andunderstanding their effects on those parameters through the **modelling and realistic rendering of what-if scenarios** and the implementation of **sensitivity analysis leveraging AR and explainable AI**.
The scenario proposed as use case is an **urban mobility application** for the city of Copenhagen,built on a mobility model covering a large area including the entire city and surrounding municipalities, with data from 7 million users and 1.6 billion GPSpings. The tool will enable users to comprehend the ramifications of **flood events** on the broader transportation and mobility network, facilitating the alignment of such insights with various urban development scenarios. The immersive scenario will allow the user to experience a **dynamic simulation** of the city of Copenhagen during a **hydrogeological emergency**.

Specific project objectives include:

- Define and develop an Immersive Visualisation scenario based on an EO use-case allowing immersive data visualisation and interactivity.
- Define, model, develop and deploy an EO-specific application (Visu4EO app) for Immersive Visualisation.
- Explore Advanced AI Techniques from eXplainable AI, Physics-inspired AI, and/or Generative AI for modelling, rendering, and user interactions.
- Assess societal, ethical, scientific, and business impacts of Visu4EO issues and define roadmap for scaling up and adoption of this technology in EO leading to development of new business models.
- Foster development of a community of providers and users of extended reality and immersive visualisation for EO, including private sector and academia, and adoption by end-users and policy-makers.
