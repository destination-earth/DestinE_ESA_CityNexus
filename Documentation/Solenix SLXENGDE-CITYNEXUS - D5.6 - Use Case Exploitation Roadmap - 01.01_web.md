# Introduction

The evolution of Digital Twin technology, driven by advancements in Earth Observation (EO), has enabled groundbreaking applications across urban resilience and environmental management. CITYNEXUS represents the forefront of innovation for urban and regional development studies by integrating advanced geospatial technologies and heterogenous data streams to model and provide the decision-making tools to address and mitigate critical challenges in urban environments.

CITYNEXUS aligns with various sectors of interest where the service can find application, namely:

**Services Related to Climate Adaptation for European Public Stakeholder**s: CITYNEXUS is an advanced analytic tool to study climate adaptation strategies. With CITINEXUS users can assess the impact of infrastructural changes on air quality, sound levels and urban liveability. By enabling the simulation of various 'what-if' scenarios, the project **aids European public stakeholders in understanding the potential effects of climate-related and policy-related changes on the urban fabric**, thus preparing cities to adapt to and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. The product has been developed for four European cities: Copenhagen and Aahrus in Denmark, Seville in Spain, and Bologna in Italy. Nevertheless, the approach can be scaled up to other European cities facing similar challenges related to mobility and environmental pollution (air quality, noise), aligning with the EU’s broader goals of sustainability and resilience.

**Services Related to Computational Geoscience and Modelling at Regional or Local Scales**: CITYNEXUS is built upon latest geospatial and Artificial Intelligence modelling, where data from multiple sources (EO, meteorological data from ECMWF's ERA5, High Frequency Location Based Data (HFLB) and air quality monitoring and noise level data from fixed monitoring stations and collected via mobile sensors) is utilised to create scenario planning models. These models predict the outcomes of urban planning decisions, such as the redesign of road networks or the implementation of low-emission zones (LEZ), enabling decision making analysis at both regional and local scales. This integration allows **examination of how specific interventions can alter environmental conditions** (pollution and noise levels) **and urban dynamics** (human mobility), which is crucial for effective urban planning and development.

**Services Related to Data & DestinE Service Usage**: CITYNEXUS extensively draws from the DestinE Data Portfolio (Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, ECMWF's ERA5, NASA MERRA-2, Daily Global Forecast Layer from DestinE Digital Twin, Copernicus Digital Elevation Model and CORINE Land Cover map). This not only demonstrates the project’s capability in harnessing DestinE services but also strengthen its potential to be integrated into broader EU data strategies, **contributing to the EU's digital and data-driven initiatives**.

**Services Related to Urban and Regional Development**: At its core, CITYNEXUS addresses urban and regional development challenges by providing decision making tools that **allow city planners and policymakers to visualise and predict the outcomes of various urban interventions** either climate or policy induced (such as creation of LEZ or redesign of road networks). This project supports sustainable urban planning by improving traffic flow, lowering pollution levels for noise and air quality, and increasing overall urban liveability.

# Exploitation Roadmap

The roadmap includes:

-   Maintain a free demonstration tier on DestinE to promote the product and grow the user base
-   Evolving from current MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to a market-ready product
-   Executing targeted marketing efforts
-   Initiating commercial exploitation and sales activities

## CITYNEXUS sustainability in DestinE ecosystem

To ensure the long-term sustainability of **CITYNEXUS** within the **DestinE ecosystem**, the consortium successfully applied for and was awarded a contract to further develop the service and maintain its operation—providing a **free tier on DestinE for at least two years**. The enhanced version of the service will incorporate **simulation capabilities for extreme weather events**, such as **urban flooding**, as well as an **air quality model** to evaluate the environmental impacts of flooding and infrastructure interventions. These features aim to support **urban resilience** and **public health planning**.

The **European Space Agency (ESA)** funded the deployment of the current **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and covered the initial operational costs on DestinE. With this foundation in place, the focus will shift toward **building a strong user base**, supported by a **tiered and usage-based pricing strategy** to attract a diverse and expanding customer portfolio.

As the project transitions from ESA-supported operations to a **self-sustaining model**, the Free Tier on DestinE will play a key role in user acquisition. The roadmap includes a combination of **financial planning**, **operational refinements**, and **continuous improvement mechanisms** to ensure both the stability and the evolution of the service offering.

## Evolving the current prototype

The evolution of CITYNEXUS from a demonstrator into a fully operational, scalable, and market-ready service is shaped by both the solid foundations laid during the DestinE prototype phase and the identified needs of end users and institutional stakeholders. Building on its successful deployment in multiple urban contexts and its onboarding to the DestinE infrastructure, the next stage of development aims to strengthen CITYNEXUS across three strategic dimensions: technological enrichment, spatial and thematic scaling, and long-term service sustainability.

A central focus of the roadmap is the deeper and more seamless integration of CITYNEXUS into the core components of the DestinE ecosystem. Particular attention will be given to future interoperability with the **Digital Twin for Weather-Induced Extremes**, which offers a unique opportunity to simulate and assess the cascading effects of short-term climate events—such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, or storm surges—on urban mobility and air quality. By leveraging predictive indicators from this Digital Twin, CITYNEXUS will be able to extend its scenario-based planning tools to encompass acute environmental disruptions, helping city managers anticipate and adapt to rapid shifts in urban conditions.

In parallel, the integration with the **Digital Twin for Climate Change Adaptation** will enhance long-term planning capabilities by enabling the simulation of mitigation measures and resilience strategies in response to evolving climate scenarios. This includes assessing how shifts in temperature, wind patterns, or precipitation might affect emissions distribution and transport system efficiency, particularly in areas vulnerable to heat stress or poor air circulation.

A significant technical upgrade under consideration is the incorporation of **short-term, high-resolution forecasts from ERA5**, particularly the 4-day outlook products that will become available through DestinE. These data would allow CITYNEXUS to evolve beyond retrospective and static scenario analysis toward more dynamic, near-real-time forecasting applications. While the integration of such forecasts with user-defined intervention scenarios—such as assessing how a traffic policy might influence PM2.5 concentrations under an approaching weather system—is conceptually promising, it also presents considerable methodological and operational challenges. These include the alignment of temporal and spatial resolutions, the need for robust uncertainty quantification, and the computational demands of running multiple predictive scenarios in a short time frame. As such, this development remains a medium-term objective, requiring further research and validation before full implementation. Nevertheless, its potential to support anticipatory governance and proactive urban policy responses makes it a valuable direction for future exploration.

To support the increasing complexity of simulations and high-resolution data processing, CITYNEXUS will adopt advanced computational strategies consistent with the high-performance expectations of the DestinE ecosystem. The platform processes complex, multi-dimensional datasets and executes computationally intensive simulations, particularly during “what-if” scenario modelling. This creates a core challenge: delivering interactive, near-real-time outputs without compromising scientific rigour or scalability.

To address this, CITYNEXUS already leverages **GPU-accelerated processing** to enhance computational efficiency across its simulation pipelines. Tasks such as dynamic scenario rendering, environmental model execution, and indicator aggregation benefit from GPU acceleration, enabling rapid and concurrent processing of urban-scale data layers. Building on this foundation, the platform will adopt **adaptive computational frameworks** capable of dynamically allocating compute resources based on scenario complexity, user load, and time sensitivity. This will ensure sustained performance under diverse usage conditions.

Performance testing will remain central to the CITYNEXUS development strategy. Systematic **benchmarking in GPU-enabled environments** will be conducted to identify bottlenecks, test scalability limits, and refine algorithmic performance. Iterative optimisation cycles will be carried out to improve both computational throughput and simulation accuracy. These efforts are critical to ensuring that CITYNEXUS meets DestinE’s high-performance criteria and provides a responsive and reliable experience for institutional users who depend on timely, actionable insights.

In terms of geographical scalability, CITYNEXUS has been successfully demonstrated in four diverse cities—Copenhagen, Bologna, Aarhus, and Seville. However, the system’s modular architecture and generalisable model design allow for straightforward adaptation to new cities with varying data availability and policy priorities. Beyond urban contexts, the platform can also be scaled to regional applications, enabling cross-city comparisons, policy harmonisation, and strategic planning across larger territories such as metropolitan corridors or multi-municipality regions. This scalability makes CITYNEXUS suitable not only for local use but also for broader institutional programmes at national or supranational level, such as regional climate action plans or EU cohesion policy implementation.

Beyond technical enhancements, CITYNEXUS will continue to evolve as a **user-centric and policy-aligned decision support tool**. The Explainable AI components will be expanded to support clearer communication of modelling assumptions, data provenance, and the expected impacts of interventions. Planned developments include the addition of **uncertainty metrics, confidence intervals**, and **semantic explanations** for AI-generated outputs. These features are critical to ensuring trust, interpretability, and policy legitimacy, especially when communicating outcomes to non-technical decision-makers and the public.

The service roadmap also considers **interoperability with other data services and platforms** within the DestinE Runtime Platform. CITYNEXUS will continue aligning its outputs with DestinE’s API standards, metadata conventions, and federation mechanisms. This will allow third-party applications or services to programmatically query CITYNEXUS outputs or embed them in composite dashboards and workflows, further enhancing its utility in integrated governance contexts.

In support of long-term sustainability, the consortium envisions the integration of CITYNEXUS into **upcoming EU-funded initiatives and local government strategies**, including follow-up projects like CITYNEXUS PRO. These will provide a framework for maintaining user engagement, testing new deployment models (e.g., city-owned instances or cloud-hosted SaaS models), and exploring commercial exploitation pathways where appropriate. Feedback mechanisms will remain open through the DestinE platform, and further institutional dialogues are planned to investigate adoption in other European cities that are part of the EU’s Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.

## Targeted marketing efforts

A key challenge for **CITYNEXUS** is engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders—**policymakers, urban planners, researchers, and community members**—to ensure the platform delivers maximum impact. To promote **CITYNEXUS** effectively, a multi-channel marketing approach will be employed, combining **digital outreach**, **educational engagement**, and **in-person visibility**, to implement a structured and inclusive **engagement strategy**, tailored to the needs of **DestinE’s diverse user community**. Core components of this strategy include:

-   **Interactive Workshops**: Hands-on sessions to demonstrate platform capabilities and address specific urban challenges.
-   **Promote the MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)**: Flexible, scalable training to allow users to build expertise at their own pace.
-   **Comprehensive Onboarding Package**: Beyond traditional documentation, users will benefit from step-by-step guides, video tutorials, and live Q&A sessions.
-   **Role-Specific Training Modules**: Custom learning paths for different user types—for example, tools for city planners analyzing mobility data or policymakers assessing environmental impacts.
-   **Continuous Feedback Loops**: Regular **user surveys and stakeholder consultations** will inform ongoing platform development, ensuring CITYNEXUS PRO remains aligned with evolving user needs.
-   **Digital Marketing**: Targeted campaigns on platforms like **LinkedIn**, aimed at urban planning and sustainability professionals.
-   **Educational Webinars**: Hosted in collaboration with **academic institutions**, these sessions will help engage and inform a professional audience.
-   **Industry Events**: Participation in **trade shows** and **urban planning conferences**—including interactive exhibition booths, speaker engagements, and networking events—at key venues such as those organized by **NetZeroCities** and **ICLEI Europe**.
-   **Email Marketing**: Direct outreach to stakeholders and decision-makers in relevant sectors.
-   **Strategic Partnerships**: Building alliances with organizations and institutions aligned with CITYNEXUS’s mission.
-   **Customer Success Stories**: Leveraging **video testimonials** and **detailed case studies** to showcase real-world impact, fostering trust and encouraging broader adoption.

This comprehensive strategy is designed to maximize awareness, credibility, and user engagement across multiple stakeholder groups.

## Transition to Market

CITYNEXUS’s long term exploitation strategy aims **at achieving self-sustainability by optimizing operational efficiency and expanding revenue streams**. The business model for CITYNEXUS as **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** is structured around recurring revenue generated by delivering the service to third parties via the cloud trough an API.

Depending on potential commercialization within DestinE (which, at the time of this delivery, is not yet confirmed), the service would be maintained and operated on a cloud infrastructure—either directly managed by the provider or hosted on DestinE. A demonstration tier will be maintained on DestinE for dissemination and promotional purposes.

### Value Proposition

CITYNEXUS commercializes **advanced "what-if" scenario services** and **decision-making support tools** for urban planning. Its primary market includes **municipalities, policymakers, urban planners, and public agencies** involved in sustainable urban development.

Traditional urban planning approaches often rely on static analyses or siloed data, **leaving stakeholders unable to predict the combined effects of mobility, environmental, and infrastructural changes**. Indeed, existing solutions in urban planning tend to focus narrowly on either mobility modelling or environmental metrics without offering an integrated perspective. Competitors also often **lack advanced scenario-testing capabilities, explainable AI tools**, and the scalability required to address diverse urban contexts effectively. These limitations make it difficult for cities to achieve **holistic, evidence-based decision-making**, resulting in costly trial-and-error implementations, missed opportunities for optimization, and challenges in gaining public trust.

In contrast to this, CITYNEXUS offers a **cutting-edge urban digital twin platform that transforms how cities evaluate, plan, and implement sustainable development strategies** relating to urban mobility, air quality and spatial planning. In doing so, it addresses critical needs in urban planning by providing municipalities, policymakers, and urban planners with a platform that integrates data analytics, simulation capabilities, and actionable insights. The platform enables these stakeholders to assess the outcomes of their decisions in a **virtual, risk-free environment**, ensuring smarter and more sustainable urban development.

The primary audience targeted by CITYNEXUS includes municipalities, policymakers, urban planners, and public agencies tasked with navigating the complexities of urban growth and sustainability. These potential clients have very concrete and tangible needs which are still largely unmet by existing tools. In particular:

-   **Predicting and Evaluating Policy Impacts:** Local governments must often respond to public demands for better air quality and urban amenities. Yet, they also often lack the tools to predict the outcomes of policies aimed at improving urban mobility and environmental health. For instance, a municipality introducing a **low-emission zone or pedestrian-only streets** might struggle to estimate the effect of an imposed reduction in traffic congestion in terms of traffic redistribution and air quality gains both inside the targeted area and, at broader city level. Or again, A local council might want to implement **30 km/h speed limits in residential neighbourhoods** to enhance safety and reduce emissions. CITYNEXUS allows users to simulate this policy scenario *before* any decision is made, visually and quantitatively showing how such a policy might affect travel times, impact traffic patterns or the spatial distribution of pollution, helping justify the decision to residents and stakeholders.
-   **Assessing the impact of urban design masterplans and redevelopment projects:** Cities undergoing urban regeneration often face uncertainty about the outcomes of significant redesigns. Imagine a municipality planning to convert a declining industrial area into a **mixed-use residential and commercial district**. With CITYNEXUS, users can simulate how the new layout affects commuting patterns, accessibility to services, and air quality, helping planners create a balanced design that meets economic, environmental, and social objectives.
-   **Quantifying the Effects of Major Infrastructure Changes:** Large scale transformations of involving urban infrastructure, as motorways or high-speed traffic thoroughfares, can play a major role in terms of sustainability goals or liveability. Consider a city planning to **tunnel an urban motorway** that divides a neighbourhood. CITYNEXUS enables stakeholders to simulate the reallocation of surface space for parks or housing, assessing the impact on travel times, air quality, and population density. This holistic perspective helps ensure that the investment benefits the community while minimizing disruptions.

The service integrates advanced models to simulate urban mobility and regional air quality, using two distinct approaches: the **Full Model**, that combines the **Deep Gravity Model**, a deep learning-based framework for mobility pattern analysis and **SUMO** (Simulation of Urban MObility), a microscopic traffic simulation tool, and the **Fast Model** a streamlined regression-based approach using XGBoost, that bypasses SUMO for more computationally efficient predictions. Specifically:

**Full Model, based on two key components:**

-   **Deep Gravity Model**: This AI-based model leverages deep learning to process vast datasets and uncover complex mobility patterns. It can generate origin-destination (OD) matrices as outputs for specific mobility scenarios simulating flows between locations for any urban agglomeration by leveraging information such as tessellation, population distribution, and travel demand data, making it a robust tool for predicting and analysing mobility trends under various scenarios. Compared to traditional gravity models, it offers enhanced adaptability and deeper insights thanks to the explainable-AI features.
-   **SUMO Model**: Developed by the Institute of Transportation Systems at DLR, SUMO is an advanced, open-source traffic simulation package designed for microscopic and continuous traffic modelling in large networks. SUMO is specifically designed for microscopic and continuous traffic modelling in large networks, supporting intermodal simulation that includes pedestrian traffic. Thanks to its advanced demand generation tools, utilizing traffic counts, origin-destination (OD) matrices, and virtual population models, SUMO provides a comprehensive toolkit for detailed analysis of traffic flows in complex urban environments, creating realistic traffic demand profiles. In the proposed system, SUMO will rely on the outputs of the Deep Gravity model (e.g. OD matrices) to simulate detailed vehicle movements over typical weekdays and weekend days, providing information on congestion, vehicle speed, and other traffic metrics.

**Fast Model**

This is a streamlined alternative to the full SUMO implementation, using a regression-based framework built with XGBoost, a tree-based model. It replaces the computationally intensive microscopic traffic simulation of SUMO by leveraging the same input data—road network attributes (e.g., centrality, topography, speed limits, open/closed road statuses), traffic composition (e.g., the percentage of electric vehicles and bicycles), and street occupancy. Trained on patterns derived from previously generated SUMO outputs, the model predicts pollutant metrics directly by replicating the relationship between traffic dynamics and air quality metrics. This approach delivers faster and more efficient predictions while maintaining analytical accuracy.

### Service Levels Overview

The service is structured into **three progressive tiers**:

1.  Free & Demonstration Tier Level on the DestinE:
    -   Free for all DestinE users, based on the Fast Model
    -   Offers pre-computed scenarios for Copenhagen, Bologna, Aarhus, and Seville
    -   Enables users to explore platform capabilities without technical knowledge
    -   Allows limited scenario creation and simulation using a fast model in the four target cities
    -   Offers basic customization and interactive use
2.  Commercial Tier Level (on the DestinE if possible or on a 3rd party Cloud Platform):
    -   Full access to advanced features
    -   Combines fast simulations with high-resolution SUMO model outputs
    -   Supports detailed and fully customizable scenario analysis
3.  Customization Tier Level
    -   Tailored services for cities beyond the initial four
    -   Allows integration of new datasets, custom analytics, and user-specific interfaces

        **Note on the implementation of commercial or customized tier on a 3rd party cloud platform.** The implementation of a Commercial or Customized Tier on a third-party cloud platform will have to address the issue of DestinE data usage. Although CITYNEXUS does not expose any data from the DestinE Data Lake (access to the platform is already granted to all DestinE users without requiring an upgrated profile), the **DestinE Terms and Conditions** establish strict guidelines on access and usage:

-   **Access Rights**: “Users are granted personal access to DestinE Services and Data strictly for official use within the scope of their activities, subject to acceptance of the Terms and Conditions.”
-   **Restrictions on Data Usage**: “Users shall not reproduce, distribute, license, transfer, assign, sell, disclose to, or otherwise forward the DestinE Data or any associated data, software, documentation, or other information to any third party without the prior written consent of the European Commission.”

    By isolating commercial deployments from the DestinE-hosted environment, the Commercial Tier will have to find a way to ensure that compliance with these conditions is maintained, while allowing the CITYNEXUS service to operate in a commercial context. While the restriction on data usage seems not too problematic (CITYNEXUS does not make any data available to 3rd parties), the access rights will have to be considered more carefully, mainly because of the “personal access” clause. A possible way forward could be to require for any user of CITYNEXUS, also for a 3rd party deployment, a valid account on the DestinE platform, to ensure the data access rights.
