# Introduction

This document presents the **User Validation Report** for the CITYNEXUS platform, developed as part of the Destination Earth (DestinE) Use Case portfolio. CITYNEXUS is a simulation and decision-support platform designed to help local authorities and urban planners evaluate the potential impacts of mobility and infrastructure interventions on air quality and sustainability indicators. Through its data-driven scenario analysis, the platform enables evidence-based decision-making aligned with the objectives of the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities and the broader ambitions of the DestinE initiative.

User validation is a critical milestone in the lifecycle of any applied digital twin or decision-support system. In CITYNEXUS, the validation process was not limited to checking technical correctness or platform performance; it extended to assessing usability, clarity of outputs, data interpretation, and the overall experience from a user perspective. The platform targets a diverse set of users, including municipal officers, environmental analysts, transport authorities, and regional policy-makers. Therefore, ensuring accessibility, coherence, and transparency of the tools and results is just as important as the scientific robustness of the underlying models.

Validation activities were conducted throughout the project and were concentrated in the second half, as the service matured and became publicly accessible through the DestinE platform. These activities included:

-   Direct feedback and formal reviews by the **ESA Technical Officer**.
-   Expert-based walkthroughs and usability testing led by design and UX specialists.
-   Iterative feedback from **UrbanDigital**, the lead interface with stakeholders in Copenhagen.
-   External validation by comparing mobility model outputs with publicly available vehicle count data.
-   Live demonstration feedback gathered at the **ESA Living Planet Symposium 2025**, where the platform was actively presented to a wide range of stakeholders from institutions, academia, and industry.

The validation process followed a participatory and iterative approach. Feedback was collected through both structured channels (e.g. documented reviews, walkthrough reports) and informal exchanges during demos, bilateral meetings, and public events. Particular emphasis was placed on testing **core user workflows**, such as defining areas of interest, selecting interventions, launching simulations, interpreting indicator outputs, and comparing scenarios. Each interaction with the system was assessed in terms of **clarity, functionality, and decision-making utility**.

Furthermore, user validation is seen as an ongoing process rather than a one-off activity. Several of the comments received, especially those from ESA and end users, have not only resulted in direct improvements to the platform but have also informed the **CITYNEXUS PRO roadmap**, which will continue developing the service beyond the scope of this initial prototype.

The following sections detail the validation methodology, summarise the main findings from the feedback collected, highlight specific interface and functional improvements already implemented or planned, and reflect on the lessons learned to guide the continued evolution of CITYNEXUS.

# Methodology

The user validation strategy for CITYNEXUS was designed to reflect both the exploratory nature of a research prototype and the operational expectations of a near-ready digital twin service within the Destination Earth (DestinE) ecosystem. Accordingly, the validation activities followed a multi-layered methodology combining structured reviews, practical testing, and observational feedback across different user profiles and use contexts.

The methodology was built around the following core objectives:

-   To evaluate the usability and accessibility of the CITYNEXUS platform across its main functional components;
-   To assess the clarity and interpretability of its outputs—particularly in support of real-world policy and planning decisions;
-   To identify areas where improvements in user experience (UX), user interface (UI), or communication of simulation results were needed;
-   To verify the relevance and representativity of the underlying datasets and model outputs, including traffic and air quality indicators;
-   To use findings from user feedback to directly inform system refinement and to guide future development steps under CITYNEXUS PRO.

## Validation Activities and Sources of Feedback

Validation inputs were collected through a combination of the following mechanisms, with particular emphasis on the feedback provided by **UrbanDigital**, the designated interface to the Local Council of Amager Vest (LCAV) and primary end-user partner for the CITYNEXUS use case in Copenhagen. UrbanDigital played a central role throughout the platform's validation lifecycle—offering strategic insights on platform utility, interface clarity, scenario relevance, and the potential for real-world integration into municipal workflows. The core mechanisms of input collection included:

-   **Direct validation from UrbanDigital**: Iterative feedback was gathered from UrbanDigital across several interactions, including walkthrough sessions and project-internal reviews. These covered multiple dimensions—from scenario realism to simulation logic, visual communication, and expected usability by non-technical urban stakeholders. UrbanDigital’s input helped shape the platform’s alignment with local planning concerns and ensured that outputs remain interpretable and actionable by municipalities. Several key interface and workflow adjustments were made based directly on this input.
-   **Technical reviews and comments from ESA.**  The ESA Technical Officer provided several rounds of detailed technical and usability comments based on direct testing of the CITYNEXUS platform. These were documented and reviewed collaboratively with the consortium to prioritise necessary interface and functional corrections.
-   **Expert UX/UI walkthrough sessions**. An independent expert evaluation of the CITYNEXUS platform interface was conducted in April 2025, focusing on navigation flow, labelling conventions, responsiveness, feedback mechanisms, and consistency across workflows. The output was a structured set of interface-level observations and recommendations aimed at improving the coherence and intuitiveness of the platform.
-   **Validation through public data comparison.** To complement user feedback, the team conducted a quantitative comparison between CITYNEXUS traffic estimates (derived from HFLB mobility data) and independent vehicle count datasets made available through Copenhagen’s Trafiktal camera network. This step was essential in validating the representativity of the input data and strengthening user confidence in the output indicators.
-   **Demonstration-based feedback at the Living Planet Symposium 2025 (LPS)**. The ESA Living Planet Symposium, held in Vienna in June 2025, provided an excellent opportunity to present the CITYNEXUS platform to a broad cross-section of the EO, urban policy, and digital twin communities. Over the course of the event, the team conducted numerous live demos in one-on-one and small group formats. Attendees were encouraged to test the platform, explore different scenarios, and share live or follow-up feedback. Observations were recorded on recurring questions, user expectations, and elements of confusion or surprise.

## Validation Scope

The validation covered all major functional components of the platform, including:

-   The **definition of areas of interest**, allowing users to draw custom polygons or select pre-defined administrative boundaries to focus their analysis;
-   The **scenario configuration interface**, enabling users to specify mobility-related interventions such as road closures, changes in speed limits, or tunnelisation options;
-   The **simulation engine**, tested for responsiveness, accuracy, and the speed at which it processed input data and updated result views;
-   The **output visualisation environment**, including the clarity of map displays, colour scales, indicator values, tooltips, and overlay layers for both baseline and simulated scenarios;
-   The **comparison and summary tools**, with a focus on the split-screen visualisation and summary tables showing changes in key mobility and air quality indicators.

Additionally, specific attention was given to:

-   **The clarity of indicator values and supporting metadata** – examining whether users could easily understand the meaning, units, and time references associated with each variable displayed on the map or in the result tables, and identifying where improvements in labelling or metadata presentation were needed.
-   **The responsiveness and scalability of the visual components** – checking whether tooltips, labels, and indicator values remained legible and functioned correctly across various zoom levels and screen sizes.
-   **The feedback mechanisms during simulation execution** – evaluating whether the platform provided clear visual cues or status updates to inform users when a simulation was running, had completed, or encountered an issue.
-   **The interpretability of comparative results** – in particular, assessing how clearly users could distinguish between baseline and intervention scenarios, and whether key differences were visible and intuitive (e.g., through split-screen views or result tables).

## User Typologies

Validation feedback was collected from a cross-section of user profiles reflecting the diversity of the CITYNEXUS use case ecosystem. These included:

-   **Local innovation partners** with practical planning and policy expertise, most notably UrbanDigital, who provided structured feedback based on use case testing in Copenhagen.
-   **Technical experts** and platform designers involved in the development and usability review of the service;
-   **Remote sensing and environmental data specialists** engaged through ESA-led review processes and the project’s internal verification and validation workflows;
-   **Simulation and modelling practitioners** with backgrounds in mobility, air quality, or urban systems planning;
-   **Public event participants**, including urban and EO professionals, researchers, and consultants who interacted with the platform during the Living Planet Symposium 2025.

This variety of user backgrounds ensured that CITYNEXUS was validated not only for technical accuracy, but also for the interpretability, navigability, and practical relevance of its interface and outputs. While the validation process was not aimed at conducting a formal usability study with a large sample, the diversity of profiles allowed the team to capture meaningful and actionable insights across typical user journeys.

# Summary of Key Comments and Observations

The user validation process yielded a comprehensive set of observations regarding the performance, usability, and interpretability of the CITYNEXUS platform. These comments—collected from ESA reviewers, UX experts, and public demo participants—have been essential in identifying both the platform’s current strengths and areas for refinement as it transitions from a research demonstrator to an operational DestinE service.

Importantly, it should be noted that the public release of CITYNEXUS on the DestinE platform occurred only in **early June 2025**, allowing limited time for extensive post-release testing and iteration prior to this final reporting. Nevertheless, a large proportion of the feedback has already led to tangible improvements, or is being directly integrated into the near-term development roadmap within the framework of the follow-up initiative, **CITYNEXUS PRO**.

In some cases, the feedback also highlighted **constraints and behaviours inherited from the underlying DestinE infrastructure**—such as language settings or interface layout elements—which fall outside the consortium’s direct control but have been addressed wherever possible through adaptive design.

The key validation findings are presented below by thematic category.

## Navigation and Workflow Coherence

One of the most recurring themes during the validation phase was the need for clearer navigation and workflow structure. While all necessary features were present, users sometimes struggled to understand the intended sequence of actions—particularly when defining an area of interest, configuring a scenario, and launching a simulation. Key points included:

-   The absence of **step-by-step prompts** or contextual guidance left some users uncertain whether all necessary steps had been completed before running a simulation.
-   Ambiguous UI labels—such as the use of “Save” to confirm a configuration—were flagged as potentially misleading. This has already been addressed in the updated version, where clearer alternatives like “Configure” or “Apply” have been adopted.

These issues, largely a result of the limited time window between deployment and validation, are being actively addressed with the addition of tooltips, reworded buttons, and planned onboarding enhancements to support a more intuitive flow.

## Simulation Feedback and System Responsiveness

Another frequently raised point was the lack of clear system feedback during simulation runs. While simulations typically executed successfully, the absence of visual cues made it difficult for users to confirm status. Specifically:

-   Users requested the addition of **progress indicators** or simple confirmation messages upon successful execution. These will be included in upcoming updates.
-   Several users noted that without clear completion signals, it was difficult to tell when new results had been rendered. This is being addressed through interface notifications and visual refresh cues.

The responsiveness of the platform has since been improved through updated status handling, and further refinements are planned to align more closely with real-time simulation expectations.

## Indicator Visibility and Metadata Clarity

Users appreciated the platform’s ability to present detailed metrics on mobility and air quality, but several issues emerged regarding clarity and context.

-   **Temporal ambiguity** was reported users were unsure which time windows were being represented in the indicator layers. Efforts are underway to add clearer legends and titles that explicitly state the temporal scope of each result.
-   **Unclear or missing units** in some map overlays and tables made it difficult to interpret values. While most core indicators are now properly labelled, further refinements will ensure that all units are dynamically shown and harmonised.
-   **Tooltip behaviour**, particularly at different zoom levels, led to overlapping or obstructive text. Notably, some of this behaviour stems from the **DestinE platform’s default tooltip logic**, which applies browser language settings and layout constraints not controlled by CITYNEXUS directly. Nonetheless, the team is adjusting the display thresholds and text logic to reduce these issues wherever possible.

These comments are being taken seriously and integrated into interface design revisions, including more structured metadata presentation and better in-layer explanations.

## Scenario Comparison and Visual Consistency

The comparative analysis capabilities of CITYNEXUS—especially the split-screen mode and scenario tracking—were recognised as essential features. However, users identified improvements that would significantly increase usability and decision support value.

-   The absence of a **delta (difference) layer** made it difficult to immediately visualise where and how interventions had changed the values of interest. This feature has been prioritised and is currently under implementation.
-   In split-screen comparisons, **colour scale misalignment** between the baseline and intervention maps led to visual inconsistencies. Harmonising the colour scales across views is now planned as a standard behaviour.
-   The **summary tables** were viewed as overly compact or lacking visual hierarchy, making it hard to extract key comparisons. A redesigned format is being prepared with clearer structure and grouping.

These changes are considered high-impact and are already being prototyped or scheduled for integration in the CITYNEXUS PRO development cycle.

## Language and Accessibility

Some minor but important issues were reported related to language settings and UI accessibility:

-   Several elements in the interface were initially displayed in a language other than English, depending on the user’s browser or system language settings. While this behaviour originated from the DestinE platform’s internationalisation defaults, the CITYNEXUS team implemented a correction to enforce English as the default interface language across all sessions. This ensures a consistent experience for all users, particularly during demonstrations, validation activities, and onboarding within an international context.
-   Responsiveness issues on smaller screens or laptops led to occasional overlapping menus and misaligned buttons. These are being resolved through layout adjustments and improved CSS handling.
-   The Download Data function was not always placed logically in relation to other tools. This is being addressed through interface repositioning and clearer labelling to guide users through data export.

These refinements are minor in scope but important for delivering a consistent, accessible experience across a wide range of users and device settings.

# Implemented and Planned Improvements

The feedback collected through the CITYNEXUS validation process has been instrumental in driving a number of immediate enhancements and defining priorities for future development. The consortium adopted a pragmatic and agile approach: several of the critical issues raised—particularly those related to user navigation, interface terminology, and initial simulation feedback—were addressed promptly following validation, while more complex requests have been scheduled for progressive implementation as part of the CITYNEXUS PRO roadmap.

This section provides an overview of the most relevant improvements, distinguishing between those already implemented in the current version of the platform and those in active development or planned for the near term.

## Improvements Already Implemented

Several key issues identified during early validation have already been resolved in the deployed version of CITYNEXUS:

-   **Revised terminology and button labelling**: Actions such as “Save” have been replaced with clearer alternatives like “Configure” or “Apply”, eliminating confusion about the purpose of scenario configuration steps.
-   **Initial guidance elements**: Short tooltips and clearer labels were introduced in key parts of the user workflow to help orient new users through scenario creation and execution.
-   **Simulation feedback**: A basic status confirmation mechanism has been implemented, alerting users once a simulation has been successfully submitted or completed.
-   **Interface language enforcement**: English has been established as the fixed interface language, overriding default browser settings to ensure consistent presentation across users, especially in international contexts.
-   **Performance tuning**: Minor layout and responsiveness fixes have been applied to improve usability on smaller screens and to avoid overlapping menus and toolbar elements.

These changes have already improved platform clarity, reduced user uncertainty, and enabled more effective engagement during public demos and testing sessions.

## Improvements in Progress or Planned (CITYNEXUS PRO)

A number of more substantial improvements are currently in development or planned for delivery under CITYNEXUS PRO, which will continue evolving the platform over the coming months. These include:

-   **Delta layer visualisation**: A new set of comparative map layers is being implemented to show the difference between baseline and simulated scenarios for each indicator. This feature will allow users to immediately identify areas where interventions have had positive or negative impacts.
-   **Wizard Implementation**. To enhance usability and help user make the most of CITYNEXUS advanced capabilities, we will introduce **wizards,** step-by-step guides designed to support the user in accessing and configuring the more complex features with ease. The wizard provides contextual guidance, helpful explanations, and smart defaults to streamline the workflow. This ensures that even sophisticated operations can be completed confidently and efficiently. The wizards will be available directly within the interface whenever the user needs a supported feature.
-   **Harmonised colour scales in split-screen views**: A mechanism will be introduced to ensure that colour legends and scale thresholds are aligned when comparing multiple scenarios side-by-side, preventing misinterpretation of results.
-   **Expanded metadata and time references**: Each simulation result will include clear indicators of the temporal window it represents (e.g., “typical working day, annual average”), along with complete unit labels for each variable.
-   **Scenario summary redesign**: The summary tables will be restructured to improve readability, introduce clearer groupings, and highlight changes more intuitively across scenarios and indicators.
-   **Simulation progress indicator**: A dedicated progress bar or notification system will be introduced to give users real-time feedback during simulation execution, reducing uncertainty and improving perceived responsiveness.
-   **Integrated onboarding and help features**: New users will benefit from a more structured introduction to the platform through embedded guides, contextual help buttons, and an optional onboarding walkthrough.
-   **Reorganisation of download/export tools**: The placement and labelling of download functions will be streamlined and made more accessible, aligning them with typical user workflows.

These planned enhancements directly address the most critical feedback received and aim to ensure CITYNEXUS not only meets DestinE service expectations but also provides a model for user-centric urban digital twin interfaces.

# Conclusion

The user validation phase of CITYNEXUS has played a central role in ensuring that the platform not only meets its technical and scientific goals, but also aligns with the real-world needs and expectations of its target user community. Through a combination of expert testing, ESA-led reviews, comparative data validation, and live feedback collected during public demonstrations, the consortium was able to identify and respond to a number of important usability and interpretability issues. UrbanDigital’s contributions ensured that CITYNEXUS remained grounded in practical urban policy contexts. Their validation helped calibrate the interface, scenario design features, and comparison logic to the expectations of municipal stakeholders.

The validation process confirmed that CITYNEXUS provides a solid foundation as a digital twin service supporting urban scenario analysis for mobility and air quality planning. Users recognised the platform’s capacity to simulate the impacts of infrastructure and policy interventions and appreciated the depth and variety of its outputs. At the same time, the feedback highlighted areas where interface clarity, comparative visualisation, and onboarding support could be strengthened to improve the overall user experience.

Several key issues—such as ambiguous interface labels, limited simulation feedback, and inconsistencies in scenario comparison—have already been addressed in the current version of the platform. Others, including the addition of delta layers, harmonised colour scales, and improved metadata presentation, are scheduled for delivery as part of the CITYNEXUS PRO development roadmap.

In addition, the validation process helped surface implementation-level challenges inherited from the DestinE platform environment (e.g., tooltip logic, language default settings), which the team either adapted to or resolved where possible.

Importantly, the timing of the validation—taking place immediately following the release of CITYNEXUS on the DestinE platform in early June 2025—ensured that the feedback captured user reactions to the operational service, rather than a prototype. This makes the insights especially valuable as the project transitions into its next phase of development and engagement.

The CITYNEXUS consortium remains committed to a user-driven development approach and will continue to integrate feedback iteratively, not only through structured reviews but also via ongoing usage monitoring, direct user engagement, and participation in future DestinE knowledge exchange activities.
